Documentation for AlphaViz.
=====================================

AlphaViz is an automated visualization pipeline to link the identifications found in the analysis with the original raw MS data and easily assess their individual quality or the overall quality of whole samples. AlphaViz is freely available, open-source and available on all major Operating Systems. It can be used with a graphical user interface (GUI) or as a regular Python package.

This documentation is intended as an API for direct Python use. For more information, see AlphaViz on `GitHub <https://github.com/MannLabs/alphaviz/>`_.
